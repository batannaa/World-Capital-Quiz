The Capital City Quiz is an engaging web application designed to test and improve knowledge of world geography.

The application is a full-featured Full-Stack quiz that presents the user with a country name and requires them to enter its capital city. The application provides instant feedback: the user receives confirmation for a correct answer or a game over notification if the answer is incorrect.

Key Features:
Cumulative Score: Tracks the score accumulated within a single gaming session.

Dynamic Content: Questions (countries and their capitals) are loaded from a PostgreSQL database.

Full Processing Cycle: Uses Express.js for routing, handling user requests (POST), and rendering dynamic HTML pages.

This project demonstrates skills in server-side rendering (EJS/HTML) and persistent data management in a relational database.
